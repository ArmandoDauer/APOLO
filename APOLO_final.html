These scenarios usually happen when there isn’t enough demand to sustain a regular service, either due to the population distribution or due to the low-demand operation hours. Also, minimize the carbon footprint of the overall transport in the area. It may be related to reduce the number of private transports in favour for the use of a public alternative (the DRT) or eliminating the inefficiencies of an existing PT that lead to excessive pollution.",
    "be_mobility_alternative": "Be a mobility alternative: In an area which relies heavily on existing public transport or private transport. Therefore, this new system will serve as an alternative transportation option. As an example, it may focus on reducing the use of private vehicles by offering a premium public transportation, with increased comfort, costing a little more than the conventional transport, but at a fraction of the cost of a private transport.",
    "serve_population_in_need": "Serve the population in need: DRT systems ensure accessibility where traditional public transport falls short, catering to groups like seniors, people with disabilities, and those in remote areas. Their flexible, on-demand services enhance mobility options and promote community inclusivity.",
    "Feed_other_transportation_systems": "Feed other transportation systems: The system will serve to provide access for larger transportation systems, such as airports, ports, train and bus stations. It makes a bridge between passengers’ home (or close passengers gathering locations) and these mass transportation systems.",
    "Complement_existing_PT_gaps": "Complement existing PT gaps: In these cases, the existing PT cannot cover all passenger needs. Therefore, an additional system is required to serve the demand that cannot be served by the existing service.",
    "Provide_transport_in_rural_areas": "Provide transport in rural areas: DRT systems bridge gaps in rural transit by offering tailored routes and schedules. This improves access to essential services, jobs, and regional connections, reducing reliance on private vehicles and fostering sustainable community development"

The most common trip purposes for this group are medical appointments, shopping, and leisure activities. This demographic generally places a higher value on comfort (such as door-to-door and direct service) rather than strict punctuality (e.g. low-income, impaired, elderly).",
    "time_sensitive_passengers": "Time Sensitive Passengers: Typically composed of younger and economically active individuals, this population often uses transport for work and school-related activities.

DRTs operating during these hours can either supplement the existing transport system or entirely replace it.",
    "peak_hours_only": "Peak hours only: DRTs operating exclusively during peak hours can help address excess demand that a regular system cannot handle, either by increasing the supply of vehicles and routes or by providing access to high-capacity transport modes. Additionally, in scenarios where these DRTs operate independently, peak hours may be the only viable timeframe for their operation.",

As a result, regular transport services often struggle to implement a viable operation, frequently reducing service frequency or, in more extreme cases, ceasing operations entirely.

    "close_to_the_request_point": "Close to the Request Point: Passengers are picked up and dropped off near their trip’s origin and destination but not at a fixed pre-determined point. Allowing passengers to walk tens (or sometimes hundreds) of meters from their origin enables pickups or drop-offs near arterial roads and avenues, facilitating more time- and cost-efficient routes.

These locations can be either physical or virtual, and, in the case of physical points, they may or may not be marked.

However, minor deviations (usually within a predefined time/distance limit) are allowed to accommodate specific passenger requests.
